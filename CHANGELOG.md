## Descriptive changelog
(All dates are DD.MM.YYYY)

##### 0.0.9-SNAPSHOT - 22.4.2019 Adding modular integer support, changing api
- Added modular integers - ModularBigInteger
- Added modInverse method to BigInteger
- Extracted interfaces that model big numbers better (BigNumber<BigType> interface and accompanying interfaces)
- Implemented integer reciprocal based on newton iteration (Based on paper by Yiping Cheng, Ze Lie : Refinement of a newton reciprocal algorithm for arbitrary precision numbers)
- Implemented division by reciprocal multiplication. Not used by division at the moment as it is unoptimized and slower than basecase division in ealry benchmarks.
- Fixed a bug in Int32 shift right when shift amount was an exact multiple of word size 
- Added constructor overloads
- Added value methods (intValue, longValue...)
- Renamed invPrecise() bigInteger method to not()
- Renamed numberOfDigits() to numberOfDecimalDigits()
- Introduced BigNumber and BitwiseOperations interfaces 
- Added iOS ARM 32bit support
