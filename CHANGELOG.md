## Descriptive changelog
(All dates are DD.MM.YYYY)

##### 0.1.0 - 31.7.2019
- Added toByteArray and fromByteArray
- Added toFloat and toDouble to BigInteger and ModularBigInteger classes
- Added BigInteger creation from Float and Double by using `tryFromFloat` and `tryFromDouble`, with optional exact 
parameter to preserve precision.
- Added BigInteger comparison with Float and Double
- Added BigDecimal configuration option to switch to expanded representation instead of scientific when calling `toString()`
- Improved ModularBigInteger exponentiation algorithm, based on Bruce Schneier Applied Cryptography pesudocode

##### 0.0.9 - 11.5.2019 Adding modular integer support, changing api
- Added modular integers - ModularBigInteger
- Added modInverse method to BigInteger
- Extracted interfaces that model big numbers better (BigNumber<BigType> interface and accompanying interfaces)
- Implemented integer reciprocal based on newton iteration (Based on paper by Yiping Cheng, Ze Lie : Refinement of a newton reciprocal algorithm for arbitrary precision numbers)
- Implemented division by reciprocal multiplication. Not used by division at the moment as it is unoptimized and slower than basecase division in ealry benchmarks.
- Fixed a bug in Int32 shift right when shift amount was an exact multiple of word size 
- Added constructor overloads
- Added value methods (intValue, longValue...)
- Renamed invPrecise() bigInteger method to not()
- Renamed numberOfDigits() to numberOfDecimalDigits()
- Introduced BigNumber and BitwiseOperations interfaces 
- Added iOS ARM 32bit support
